SQL IMDb Movie Analysis Project

This project was completed as part of the **PwC India × upGrad – Business Analytics & Consulting Program**.

The objective was to analyse IMDb movie data using **pure SQL** and generate actionable insights to support strategic decision-making for a global movie release.

---

## 📌 Business Context
RSVP Movies, an Indian production house, planned to release a movie for a **global audience**.  
To reduce risk and improve decision-making, historical IMDb movie data from the past three years was analysed.

The entire analysis was performed using SQL queries without modifying the dataset externally.

---

## 🗂 Dataset & Structure
The dataset consisted of multiple related tables covering:
- Movies
- Ratings
- Genres
- Production companies
- Cast & crew
- Release information

An ERD was used to understand table relationships before writing queries.

## 🔍 Analysis Approach
The SQL analysis was divided into **four segments**, each addressing a specific business objective:

### **Segment 1**
Basic exploration, movie counts, country-wise and year-wise trends.

### **Segment 2**
Genre performance, rating analysis, and identifying high-performing categories.

### **Segment 3**
Production houses, directors, and actors contributing to success.

### **Segment 4**
Advanced insights combining ratings, votes, and profitability indicators.

All queries were optimised, readable, and written using appropriate joins and aliases.
